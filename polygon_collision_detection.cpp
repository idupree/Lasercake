Interesting observation: Under a linear transformation, a line stays a line, and the topology stays the same. Here, we'll try to make the situation simpler by applying a skew:

move t3 to (0,0,0)

(0,0,0)(t1x t1y t1z)(t2x t2y t2z)
want t1z = 0 t2z = 0
addition to the z coordinate = a*x + b*y
EQ1) -t1z = a*t1x + b*t1y
EQ2) -t2z = a*t2x + b*t2y

t2x*EQ1 - t1x*EQ2) t2z*t1z-t1z*t2x = b(t1y*t2x - t2y*t1x)
b = (t2z*t1x-t1z*t2x) / (t1y*t2x - t2y*t1x)
since a and b are only different in an x vs y way, logically...
a = (t2z*t1y-t1z*t2y) / (t1x*t2y - t2x*t1y)
(denom == 0 iff t1 and t2 are collinear in the plane - just rotate the triangle 90 degrees until they're not.)

We could just do the computations at a factor of that denominator for a little while.
D = (t1x*t2y - t2x*t1y) = the denominator of a
Let A = (t2z*t1y-t1z*t2y) = a*D
Let B = -(t2z*t1x-t1z*t2x) = b*D
Then we'd get two transformed z values...

Ideally...
z1 = l1z + a*l1x + b*l1y
Multiply by D...
D*z1 = D*l1z + A*l1x + B*l1y

We only care about the *proportion* between z1 and z2, so Dz1/Dz2 are just as good, as long as we don't get rounding error.
Both negative or both positive -> no collision
Otherwise, ideally...
let l1xy = l1 projected onto the plane, etc
ltxy = the point where (l1, l2) intersects the plane
ltxy = ((0 - z1) / (z2 - z1)) l2xy + ((z2 - 0) / (z2 - z1)) l1xy
More practically...
ltxy = ((0 - D*z1) / (D*z2 - D*z1)) l2xy + ((D*z2 - 0) / (D*z2 - D*z1)) l1xy
ltxy = ((0 - D*z1) l2xy + (D*z2 - 0) l1xy) / (D*z2 - D*z1)

Now we can multiply everything by (D*z2 - D*z1)...
(D*z2 - D*z1)ltxy = D*z2*l1xy - D*z1*l2xy

And also multiply the triangle coordinates by (D*z2 - D*z1), and then do the clockwiseness check above!

This is a perfect accuracy collision check.
The downside is that it (in the worst case) has *four* factors of the distances between two points,
  (That's before the clockwiseness function, but the clockwiseness function can be implemented here without squaring the magnitude)
and so we couldn't use values that differ by more than the fourth log of our coordinate type,
namely... 64/4 bits, or 16 bits.
(D = diff^2, D(z2 - z1) = diff^3, D(z2 - z1)ltxy = diff^4, )
